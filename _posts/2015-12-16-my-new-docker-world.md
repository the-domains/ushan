What currently is of my interest?

Docker! Docker is changing how I do virtualization. I have slowly changed from host based virtualization (VMWare Workstation, Virtualbox, Hyper-V, Xen and similar products) to operating system virtualization. What I love about docker: Runs my application in an isolated environment on a host i.e. the sole purpose of running a virtual machine but, in a fraction of a second.
